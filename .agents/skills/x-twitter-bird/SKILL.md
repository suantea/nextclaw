# X / Twitter via bird

Use this skill when the user wants X/Twitter operations in this repo workflow.

What this skill owns:

- Store and reuse local X credentials for `bird`
- Read bookmarks / likes / tweets / threads / search results
- Draft or send posts and replies when the user explicitly asks

## Primary contract

- Credentials live in a user-local file, not in the repo:
  - default path: `~/.nextclaw/secrets/x-bird.json`
- All X operations go through `scripts/x-bird.mjs`
- The script passes `--auth-token` and `--ct0` explicitly to `bird`
- Do not rely on `bird` auto-reading env vars; the installed `bird 0.9.0` in this environment hard-fails unless the CLI args are present

## Setup

Store credentials once:

```bash
node .agents/skills/x-twitter-bird/scripts/x-bird.mjs auth set --auth-token '<token>' --ct0 '<token>'
```

Check the current account:

```bash
node .agents/skills/x-twitter-bird/scripts/x-bird.mjs whoami --plain
```

## Common commands

Read bookmarks:

```bash
node .agents/skills/x-twitter-bird/scripts/x-bird.mjs bookmarks -n 20 --json
```

Read likes:

```bash
node .agents/skills/x-twitter-bird/scripts/x-bird.mjs likes -n 20 --json
```

Search:

```bash
node .agents/skills/x-twitter-bird/scripts/x-bird.mjs search 'DeepSeek V4 reasoning_content' -n 10 --json
```

Read a tweet or thread:

```bash
node .agents/skills/x-twitter-bird/scripts/x-bird.mjs read <tweet-id-or-url> --json
node .agents/skills/x-twitter-bird/scripts/x-bird.mjs thread <tweet-id-or-url> --json
```

Post only after the user explicitly asks:

```bash
node .agents/skills/x-twitter-bird/scripts/x-bird.mjs tweet 'text here'
node .agents/skills/x-twitter-bird/scripts/x-bird.mjs reply <tweet-id-or-url> 'text here'
```

## Rules

- Treat `auth_token` and `ct0` as full login credentials
- Never write them into repo files, docs, tests, or iteration logs
- Before posting, confirm the exact text or use the user-provided text verbatim. If the user has explicitly granted standing authorization for stable minor release posts, do not request confirmation again; publish the release-validated draft directly after its public link returns 200.
- Stable minor release posts should include one public-safe, high-information image by default. Choose the best fit among a real product screenshot, a benchmark/release summary card, AI-generated campaign art, or an AI-assisted composition containing an unaltered real screenshot. Never present generated UI as a real product screenshot or change verified release facts. Patch releases do not post unless the user explicitly overrides this rule.
- When `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` is required, invoke this wrapper with a Node version that supports environment proxies (for example `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1 <node-24+> scripts/x-bird.mjs ...`). The wrapper launches `bird` with the same Node executable so the proxy setting reaches X requests.
- The wrapper refreshes current GraphQL query IDs before every `tweet` or `reply`. If X returns a limit-looking error while the account timeline disproves it, verify the refreshed write operation before concluding that the account is rate-limited.
- A successful write response is not completion by itself. Read the returned post ID/URL through this wrapper and verify the expected author, text, and media presence; only then report success and record the URL. Missing IDs, readback failures, or mismatched content remain incomplete and must not trigger a blind repost.
- Prefer `--json` for read/search workflows so downstream analysis stays structured
- If the user asks for only reading, do not post, like, follow, or unbookmark anything
