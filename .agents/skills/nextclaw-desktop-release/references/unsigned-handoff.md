# Unsigned Desktop Release Playbook

## Overview
Use this skill when you must distribute desktop binaries without code-signing certificates, while keeping packaging integrity verifiable and onboarding steps beginner-friendly.

## When to Use
- macOS and/or Windows desktop release is required, but signing credentials are unavailable.
- Users report macOS "app is damaged" or cannot find "Open Anyway".
- You need a repeatable GitHub release checklist for unsigned binaries.

## Core Principle
- Differentiate **corrupted package** vs **unsigned package**:
  - Corrupted package: `codesign --verify --deep --strict` fails. Must be fixed in build pipeline.
  - Unsigned package: `codesign --verify` can pass, but `spctl --assess` rejects. This is expected without certificate/notarization.
- Differentiate **system trust approval** vs **product startup**:
  - Trust approval failure happens before or around process launch and must be explained as unsigned macOS policy.
  - Product startup failure happens after the app starts and must be diagnosed with launcher logs, GUI lifecycle, runtime health, and AI smoke.
  - Do not use unsigned guidance to explain away real `ERR_FAILED`, `ENOTEMPTY`, `ENAMETOOLONG`, or no-window startup bugs.

## Packaging Validation Workflow
1. Download release asset from GitHub.
2. Mount DMG and check app integrity:
   - `codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=2 "<App>.app"`
3. Check Gatekeeper assessment:
   - `spctl --assess --type execute --verbose=4 "<App>.app"`
4. For Windows unpacked zip, confirm executable exists:
   - `unzip -l "<zip>" | rg -n "\\.exe$"`

## Local Handoff Rule
- For a local unsigned macOS build, the no-password path is user approval through macOS UI. Do not ask the user to unlock Keychain, import a certificate, or trust a local identity unless the product policy changes to signed builds.
- A local build can still be tested before broad handoff:
  - run direct `.app` launch when the current machine allows it;
  - run DMG real-profile smoke against the existing desktop data dir;
  - inspect the current launch log window for startup blockers;
  - when credentials are available, run a GUI-launched AI reply smoke.
- If macOS blocks a fresh cdhash before JS starts, say that explicitly and give the unsigned approval path. If JS starts, continue debugging product logs instead of stopping at Gatekeeper language.

## Beginner User Guide Template

### macOS
1. Open `.dmg`, drag app to `Applications`.
2. Double-click app once from `Applications`.
3. If blocked, click `Done` in the popup first.
4. Go to `System Settings -> Privacy & Security`, scroll to bottom, click `Open Anyway`.
5. Open app again.
6. If still marked damaged, run:
```bash
xattr -cr "/Applications/<App Name>.app"
```

### Windows
1. Unzip package.
2. Double-click `<App Name>.exe`.
3. If SmartScreen appears, click `More info -> Run anyway`.

## GitHub Release Checklist
1. Use `beta` naming convention if channel is beta.
2. Mark release as `pre-release`.
3. Keep release notes in two full language blocks if bilingual is required:
   - `English Version` first.
   - `中文版` second.
4. Include:
   - User-facing changes
   - Upgrade impact (unsigned behavior)
   - Beginner open/install steps
   - Validation summary (CI run id + local verification)

## Common Pitfalls
- Removing quarantine in CI smoke test can hide real download-path behavior.
- Telling users only "right click -> open" is often insufficient for beginners.
- Omitting "click Done first, then Open Anyway in Privacy & Security" causes high support churn.
- Treating "unsigned" as the explanation for every macOS launch failure hides real runtime bugs.
- Treating a previously approved local `.app` as proof that a newly built DMG will open can miss new cdhash or helper-signing failures.
