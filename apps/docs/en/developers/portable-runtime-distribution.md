# Package and distribute Portable Service Apps

Portable Runtime separates the portable App from the native runner. An App author builds one WebAssembly Component and packages it in a `.napp`; NextClaw supplies the platform runner. That is why a pure WASI App can use a universal artifact instead of separate Windows, Linux, and macOS App builds.

## Package a universal App

```bash
nextclaw app check . --json
nextclaw app test . --json
nextclaw app pack . --out reading-log.napp --json
nextclaw app validate-publish . --json
```

Use `distribution.mode: "universal"` when the package contains only portable resources. The current native runner distribution covers macOS arm64, Linux x64, and Windows x64. The App package does not include a copy of the runner and does not require an end user to install Rust, Cargo, Wasmtime, or a system Node.js runtime.

Choose a targeted distribution only when the App really includes platform-native resources. A native-process Service may need one artifact per supported target; that is a different trade-off from a portable Component.

## Install and update safely

```bash
nextclaw app install ./reading-log.napp --json
nextclaw app enable <app-id> --json
nextclaw app update <app-id> --version <version> --json
nextclaw app rollback <app-id> --version <installed-version> --json
```

The installed host owns the active version, managed data, grants, and lifecycle operations. Update or rollback does not authorize new files, domains, secrets, Providers, models, or Agents by implication. If a new version changes a request, the host re-evaluates the relevant grant and readiness state.

## Keep the default self-contained

Use the portable package as the default installation path. It should include the Component, Panel, manifests, test fixture, and any normal packaged assets.

Sometimes an App needs a service outside the package, for example a managed Redis instance or a proprietary API. In that case:

1. Declare it in `requires.capabilities` or `requires.resources`; never hide it in code or a connection string.
2. Show a clear `needs-capability` or `needs-configuration` state at installation.
3. Offer a safe setup Action that an authorized Agent can perform where possible.
4. Leave login, payment, account ownership, or irreversible third-party authorization to the user.
5. Keep credentials in the NextClaw secret owner, never in the artifact or manifest.

An external dependency is not a reason to weaken the package boundary. It is a documented exception with an explicit setup path and an enablement block until it is ready.

## Marketplace and release checks

Run `validate-publish` before Marketplace submission. It validates the App and declared artifact shape; it does not replace your own `app test` cases. A WASI Service App must combine `runtime.profile: "wasi"`, Service `protocol: "wasi-component"`, a `component.entry` that points to a `.wasm` file, and `distribution.mode: "universal"`. The Marketplace checks these declarations and the actual Component artifact again, rejecting mismatched combinations.

```bash
nextclaw app publish . --json
nextclaw app marketplace info <app-id> --json
nextclaw app install <app-id> --json
nextclaw app operations --json
nextclaw app enable <app-id> --json
```

Personal submissions enter review first. After approval and public listing, another user can download and install the same universal artifact from the Registry by App ID. Installation still requires explicit enablement. The release path also verifies the portable runtime and reference App across the supported platform matrix before a stable runtime channel is accepted.
