# NextClaw CLI: Capability Map and Complete Command Reference

The `nextclaw` CLI is a first-class way to operate NextClaw. When a product capability can be expressed clearly as a structured operation, NextClaw aims to make it available from the command line so users, developers, scripts, CI jobs, and other Agents can work with the same underlying capabilities.

This does not mean moving every interface into a terminal. Visual, drag-and-drop, and direct-manipulation work can remain GUI-first. The CLI is most useful for runtime management, queries and diagnostics, repeatable operations, automation, and system integration.

Use this page to:

- see what NextClaw can currently do, grouped by capability area; and
- look up the complete CLI surface by command path.

The registered command tree is the source of truth for this page. Adding, removing, or renaming a CLI command requires updating both language versions, and repository tests verify that this reference covers the real command surface.

## How to use this reference

This page lists every executable command path and its primary purpose. To inspect the complete arguments, defaults, and options for one command, run:

```bash
nextclaw <command> --help
```

Use `nextclaw --version` to inspect the installed version. Many query and management commands support `--json`; check the command help before integrating it into a script, CI job, or Agent. For first-time setup, start with [Quickstart](/en/guide/getting-started). For the small set of commands used most often, see [Core Commands](/en/guide/core-commands).

See [Service Apps](/en/guide/service-apps) for the user workflow and [Develop a WASM Service App](/en/developers/portable-service-apps) for runtime development commands.

`app dev` and `app call` accept a schema v2 App root directly. A package with one Service is selected automatically; use `--component <service-id>` when a package has multiple Services. Local `.napp` files can be installed by relative path, for example `nextclaw app install ./my-app.napp`.

`app invoke <app-id> <action-name> --input '<json>'` calls an Action on an enabled installed App, rather than a source package. It returns the call ID, trace ID, data version, and verification-record ID. Use `app verification [--acceptance <id>] [--app <id>] [--limit <n>]` to inspect the corresponding redacted, persisted runtime facts; add `--json` for machine-readable output.

`app acceptance contract|status|export` reads the single Portable Runtime acceptance registry used by the product, server, CLI, and release gate. `status` evaluates evidence against the active product version, runtime version, runner fingerprint, and contract fingerprint; only `current-passed` means the evidence is current. `export` always writes the complete machine-readable status document. Use `--locale en` for English presentation and `--app <id>` only when inspecting a non-default acceptance App.

For Apps that declare Secret slots, use `app secrets inspect <app-id>` to see required configuration without revealing values. Bind a declared slot with `app secrets bind <app-id> --slot <slot> --source env|file|exec --id <secret-id> [--provider <provider>]`, then run `app secrets verify <app-id>`. A required unbound or unresolved slot leaves the App in `needs-configuration` and blocks enable with a `SECRET_*` error code. `app secrets unbind` removes the active Secret permission; retaining App data never retains Secret bindings.

Installing an App never grants its declared directory scopes automatically. Use `app permissions inspect <app-id>` to inspect them, `app permissions document grant <app-id> --scope <scope-id> --path <directory> --mode read|read-write` to grant or replace a runtime-host directory, and `app permissions document revoke <app-id> --scope <scope-id>` to revoke it. The effective mode cannot exceed the App's declaration, and every grant change immediately retires the previous runtime mount.

## Automation guidance

- When a query or management command supports `--json`, scripts and Agents should prefer the machine-readable output.
- For non-interactive tasks, use `nextclaw exec --format text|json|jsonl` and interpret the documented exit codes.
- Before changing configuration, secrets, host services, or permanently deleting data, inspect the command's `--help` output and permission boundary.
- The CLI, UI, and built-in AI tools should call the same product owner. If the same capability behaves differently across entry points, please report it.
