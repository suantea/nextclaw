# Runtime & Hosting Manual

This manual explains how NextClaw can stay available. Use it to choose between foreground runtime, background runtime, autostart, remote access, and Docker.

## Runtime options

| Option | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| `nextclaw start` | Daily local use with a background service |
| `nextclaw serve` | Foreground debugging and log observation |
| Autostart | Recovering after login or reboot |
| Docker | Server or container deployment |
| Remote access | Opening this instance from another device |

## Recommended choices

- trying it first: `nextclaw start`
- using it daily: background runtime plus autostart
- accessing it from phone or another device: remote access
- hosting it on a server: Docker or a system-level service

Unused messaging channels stay stopped and do not keep separate processes resident. For the current tested server baseline, three-run idle measurements, and active workloads that need more memory, see [Runtime Resource Usage](/en/guide/resource-usage).

When a phone browser returns from the lock screen, background, or a short network interruption, NextClaw proactively rebuilds its realtime connection and synchronizes session and task state again. A full-page refresh is normally unnecessary.

## Important boundary

`npm i -g nextclaw` does not register autostart.  
Installing the CLI and installing a host-managed service are separate actions.
