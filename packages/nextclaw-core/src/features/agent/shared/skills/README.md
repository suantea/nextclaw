# nextclaw Skills

This directory contains built-in skills that extend nextclaw's capabilities.

## Skill Format

Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with:
- YAML frontmatter (name, description, metadata)
- Markdown instructions for the agent

## Attribution

These skills are adapted from [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)'s skill system.
The skill format and metadata structure follow OpenClaw's conventions to maintain compatibility.
